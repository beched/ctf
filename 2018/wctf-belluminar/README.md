This is a folder containing the tasks and solutions developed by LC↯BC team for the WCTF 2018 event (aka Belluminar Beijing).

Belluminar is a type of CTF competition where the teams bring their own tasks for each other.
This makes it very special and hard.

The teams also have to present their intended solutions (and they get scored for that too, that's why you cannot just make a completely unsolvable task).

Both of our tasks in 2018 have been solved by 2 teams: TokyoWesterns (1st place) and 0daysober (4th place).

Here's a link we shared with organizers before the event (you can get a deployed VM there): https://yadi.sk/d/gp-7LR323WmKMb
